# mahawaray
A web-app that allows users to search up idioms from the Urdu language.

This project was created entirely with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. 
The idioms are stored in a json file available on my github page.
The master.js essentially controls the index.html page while idioms.js ensures that our 500+ idioms are loaded up correctly for the library.html page.
